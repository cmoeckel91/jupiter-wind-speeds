# jupiter-wind-speeds
Code to compute the zonal wind speed based on Hubble Space Telescope images that uses correlation method develovped by Xylar Asay-Davis (2011, et al.). Code intitally ported to Matlab by Josh Tollefson (2017, et al.) and ported to python by Druv Punjabi (dhp@berkeley.edu). 

Developments needed: 
* Current model depends on images having the same latitude range 
* Code requires speeding up through parallelization
